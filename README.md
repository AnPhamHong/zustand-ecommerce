# zustand-ecommerce

A complete E-Commerce app for **Borcelle**, a shoe store, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Vite**.

## Description

Borcelle is an online store for shoes built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Vite**. This application features product filtering by category, price, and color, along with a search functionality by product title. The app also includes a full shopping experience, including cart management, checkout, order tracking, and user account management. The state is persisted using **Zustand's persist middleware**, ensuring that the appâ€™s state is maintained even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Product Filtering**: Filter shoes by category, price range, color, and search by title.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update product quantities in the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Simulated checkout flow that can be extended to integrate payment gateways.
- **Order Management**: Track your orders and view order status.
- **User Accounts**: User registration, login, and profile management.
- **State Persistence**: Zustand with persist middleware ensures app state is saved in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
