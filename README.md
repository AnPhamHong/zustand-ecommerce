# zustand-ecommerce

A complete E-Commerce app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Vite**.

## Description

A complete E-Commerce app built with React, TypeScript, Zustand, and Vite. It features product filtering by category, price, and color, along with search functionality by product title. The app also includes full shopping features such as cart, checkout, order management, and user accounts. The state is persisted using middleware so data remains even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Product Filtering**: Filter products by category, price range, color, and search by title.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update product quantities.
- **Checkout Process**: Simulated checkout flow that can be extended to integrate payment gateways.
- **Order Management**: Track order history and status.
- **User Accounts**: User registration, login, and profile management.
- **State Persistence**: Zustand with persist middleware ensures the app state is saved in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
